# People Per Hour Crawler

This code is written to crawl the most famous freelancing site peopleperhour.com. I have used Python to crawl this site with some amazing libraries like beautifulsoup and urllib.

You just only have to put the code in the editor and save the output from the function in the array. After, that you just have to connect it to database nad save it.
